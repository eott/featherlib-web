<p class="upperDescription">
Featherlib is a cataloging software designed to be lightweight and easy to use. You can index
anything you want, from text and images to the digital representation of physical objects. Do
you have a lot of books, but feel most library software is too cumbersome? Do you want to keep
your project files indexed and searchable? If yes, then featherlib might be for you.
<br><br>
Featherlib has no release candidate yet, but we will publish the first working version and aim
for backwards compatability, so your data can be used in any version.
